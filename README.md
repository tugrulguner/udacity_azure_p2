# Bankmarketing Data App

In this project, I am using Azure ML to perform training and find the best model using Automated ML over bankmarketing data. Then, I am deploying the best model to the endpoints, with application insights feature in it together with logging. Finally, I consume endpoints by sending data in json format to receive predictions. 

Aside from this approach, using notebook, I am creating, publishing and consuming a pipeline.

## Architectural Diagram

* First, data is uploaded from given URL
![Data uploaded](/screenshots/image1.png)

* Second, Auomated ML Experiment is run over this dataset with Classification task
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
